# USE CASE 1 - EuXFEL Data in NeXus' Golden Standard

## Abstract

There were great efforts put in the last two decades in the research community to elaborate a common standard for high data-rate macromolecular crystallography (HDRMX). This agreed "Gold Standard" builds on the NeXus/HDF5 NXmx application definition and the International Union of Crystallo-graphy (IUCr) imgCIF/CBF dictionary, and it is compatible with major data-processing programs and pipelines. Here we demonstrate the EuXFEL data packed into a NeXus file which is fully compliant with the Gold Standard by design, since it  is build directly from HDRMX NeXus definitions. We use open-source software developed both by community (cctbx) and in-house (extra-data).
